### Q: How would IMS standards be helpful in creating improving the D&I Badging Project

A: The Ims standards will play a vital role in improving the D&I badging project;
-  The Ims standards will enable the D&I open Badges contain various detailed information on the particular badging that will be implemented this badging will contain metadata about achievements such as `who earned it, who issued it, the criteria required,` and in many cases even the evidence and demonstrations of the relevant skills that will be useful. 
-  There are new features that that will also be implemented using the IMS standards for the D&I Badging project such as;
    ##### 1. Endorsements  
    ##### 2. Internationalization and multi-Linfual capabilities for the D&I badging project. 
    ##### 3. versioning 
    ##### 4. Improvements on accesibility 
    ##### 5. full adoption of JSON-LD. 
    `JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON. One goal for JSON-LD was to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing JSON to JSON-LD`. 
    ### JSON-LD allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional JSON.

- The IMS standards will make the D&I Badging project more compatible and interoperable. 

###  Q: What parts of the Journal of Open Source Software Documentation could be helpful in improving the D&I Badging Project?

A:  The Journal of Open Source Software Documentation will be helpful in impoving the CHAOSS D&I project in;
   ## Submitting a Paper, The submission requirements will be very useful. 
- The project should have an obvious research application 
- The project should be open source as per the [OSI definition](https://opensource.org/osd)
- The project should be a significant contribution to the available open source software that either enables some new research challenges to be addressed or makes addressing research challenges significantly better (e.g., faster, easier, simpler).
- The Project should be feature-complete (no half-baked solutions) and designed for maintainable extension (not one-off modifications). Minor 'utility' packages, including 'thin' API clients, and single-function packages are not acceptable.
- your Project  must be hosted in a Git-based repository, ideally together with your software.
Also,JOSS will be helpful with the submission process of the CHAOSS project. Projects associated with the submission must
- Be stored in a repository that can be cloned without registration.
- Be stored in a repository. 
- Have an issue tracker that is readable without registration.
- Permit individuals to create issues/file tickets against your repository.

 ### JOSS also provides the typical submission flow;
 This workflow will be helpful to the CHAOSS D&I Badging project;

 - Make your project available in an open repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)
 - Make sure that the project complies with the [JOSS review criteria](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html). In particular, your software should be full-featured, well-documented, and contain procedures (such as automated tests) for checking correctness.
 - The project should be written in a markdown format using the `.md` as file name including a title, summary, author names, affiliations, and key references.

### Review process 
JOSS Review process will be helpful to CHAOSS D&I Project;
- An Associate Editor-in-Chief which will act as the `maintainer` will carry out an initial check of your submission, and proceed to assign a handling editor(`Reviewer`)
- The Reviewer will assign more reviewers, and the review will be carried out in the review repository. 
- Authors, maintainers will respond to reviewer-raised issues on the project submission repository issue tracker. Reviewer,contributors contributions, like any other contributions, should be acknowledged in the repository.
- after the review has been done, authors will make a tagged release of the project and update the review issue thread in the  repository 
- The review issue will be closed 

### Software License
The JOSS Software license template will be very useful in the D&I Badging. An [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license should be included in the repository. 
`there should be an actual license file present in the repository not just a reference to the license.`

```
Acceptable: A plain-text LICENSE file with the contents of an OSI approved license
Not acceptable: A phrase such as 'MIT license' in a README file
```

### Documentation 
The JOSS Documentation will help improve the Documentation for CHAOSS D&I Badge project 
There should be a sufficient documentation for the user. A high-level overview of this documentation should be included in a `README` file. 

### Installation Instructions 
There should be a clearly stated instructions for the badge project. 

```Good: A package management file such as a Gemfile or package.json or equivalent
OK: A list of dependencies to install
Bad (not acceptable): Reliance on other software not listed by the authors
```

The authors should include examples of how to use the project (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).


## Review the D&I Badging Repository for both the Events and projects folders

### Q:  How do these folders differ from each other? 

A: The Event folder describes the processes, criteria and metrics that will be involved in Diversity & Inclusion Badging for events. There is no detailed `README.md` yet.
The event metrics  are the CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion Event Metrics which include; 
`CHAOSS-Metrics.md `
- Speaker Demographics 
- Attendees Demographics 
- Diversity Access Tickets 
- Code of conduct at event 
- Family friendliness.  

`Criteria.md` is grouped into sections with its metric questions.


The project folder has a detailed `README.md`. The metrics used for this are listed as;
- Documentation
- Issue tracker 
- Communication channels 
- Response times & QUality 
- Sentiment 

`Criteria.md` is grouped into the is grouped into sections with its metric questions.


### Q:How are they similar? 

A: They are both folders that will establish an environment where projects and events can engage in the badging program. 
- Both aim to increase understanding of the open source project and event practices that encourage greater diversity and wider inclusion of people from different backgrounds.
- Both share common goals/aims. These aims are grouped into; 

```
 CHAOSS-Metrics.md
 Criteria.md
 README.md
 Requirements.md
 badged-events.md
 ```

`Requirements.md` this is grouped into the `submission requirements`, `submission process`, `Review process` for both the Event and Project folder. 
`badged-project.md` for both folders are empty 

### Q: Are the issue templates any different when you view them in GitHub versus your local machine? If so, how?

A: The issue templates are different when you view it in Github and on the local machine,On Github it uses the Flavored Markdown which is already interpreted from the Local machine editor. On the text editor (alpha markdown) is more detailed compared to what shows up on the template. The alpha markdown `source` from the IDE `editor` on your local machine provides indicators on how to fill the attributes in the template. The template from both folders are based on the `criteria.md`. 

### Q: Explain why this project may want to use GitHub issue templates as a badging submission method.

A: Github templates provide lightweight and easy-to-use styling for all forms of writing how an detailed an information needs to be filled in an issue. Templates provide a framework `plan`  on how data can be correctly inserted, this will make the data to be checked on the event/project meets the Diversity & Inclusion Metrics. 
- Github markdown format makes styled collaborative editing easy for the templates, it uses the Flavored markdown which makes the issue template easier to work with, with the the maintainer/creator of the project/event. 
- Issues will also be coordinated with labels, this will make tracking faster, precision will also be attained.
